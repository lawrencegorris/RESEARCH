 # Research
 Spending a couple of days researching WEBDEV topics as well as putting some stuff into practice.

 ## Front End

 ### Front End Frameworks

 The big players when it comes to front end "frameworks":
 - React
 - Angular
 - Vue
 And a bit of a lesser big player:
 - Svelte

 #### Compare the frameworks:

 ##### React

 - Easy, lightweight component creation
 - Functional, stateless compoments
 - Very popular, especially among Startups
 - Many extensions available
 - Written with JSX
 - Amount of options can be overwhelming.
 - Uses 'hooks'
 - Netflix, Facebook, Khan Academy, Reddit, Uber Eats

 ##### Angular

 - Provides more 'out of the box' solution
 - Focussed on application developement
 - Most capable CLI
 - Uses TypeScript 
 - Steepest learning curve
 - Can feel complex at times 
 - Almost all of Google's apps, Firebase, Santander, Forbes, PayPal;

 ##### Vue

 - Scaled down experience
 - Offers also more out fof the box than React
 - Well written docs, but less common, since it's newer than React and Angular
 - 9gag, Nintendo, Gitlab, Behance

 ##### Svelte

 - Actually a compiler
 - Very small code size, well optimized
 - Core features only
 - No additional improvements
 - Popular but smaller and newer

 #### My thought and opinions:
 
 I probably will try out all of them in the upcoming future, creating SPAs from either the same API to make the same web app in each framework (in the best way possible), or either different apps, using different APIs each framework.

 I personally have gained the most experience with Angular up to this point and I really like it's way of working and routing (once I got the hang of it).

 Haven't tried Vue or Svelte yet, but that will change pretty soon.

 ## Back End
 Content to follow soon as more research is done.
